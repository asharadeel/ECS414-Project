## Description

HorseRacer23 is a horse racing simulator I have programmed for my first year object-oriented programming project. 

## How to Run
How to run using COMMAND PROMPT 

1. Download the repository locally using github, or use git in command line to clone this repoistory in desired folder.
    -- git clone "https://github.com/asharadeel/414project"
2. Once downloaded, use "cd" to enter .git folder. 
3. For executing the terminal/command line verison, go to **Part 1** folder. When in this folder, execute the line *"java Main.java"* to run the terminal/command line version of this project.
4. For executing the program with interface, go to **Part 2** folder. When in this folder, go into folder "out/artifacts/Part_2_jar and run *Part 2.jar* to execute the interface version. This is different because there is an additional library used, therefore compilation is required.
